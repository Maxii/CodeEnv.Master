    /// 2. the event CurrentStatePropChangingHandler(newState) is sent to subscribers
    /// 3. the value of the CurrentState enum is changed to newState
    /// 4. the lastState_ExitState() method is called 
    ///          - while in this method, realize that the CurrentState enum has already changed to newState
    /// 5. the CurrentState's delegates are updated 
    ///          - meaning the EnterState delegate is changed from lastState_EnterState to newState_EnterState
    /// 6. the newState_EnterState() method is called
    ///          - as the event in 7 has not yet been called, you CANNOT set CurrentState = nextState within newState_EnterState()
    ///              - this would initiate the whole cycle above again, BEFORE the event in 7 is called
