    //
    // 1. the state we are changing from is recorded as lastState
    // 2. the 2 events indicating a state is about to change are sent to subscribers
    // 3. the value of the CurrentState enum is changed to newState
    // 4. the lastState_ExitState() method is called 
    //          - while in this method, realize that the CurrentState enum has already changed to newState
    // 5. the CurrentState's delegates are updated 
    //          - meaning the EnterState delegate is changed from lastState_EnterState to newState_EnterState
    // 6. the newState_EnterState() method is called
    //          - as the event in 7 has not yet been called, you CANNOT set CurrentState = nextState within newState_EnterState()
    //              - this would initiate the whole cycle above again, BEFORE the event in 7 is called
    //              - you also can't just use a coroutine to wait then change it as the event is still held up
    //          - instead, change it a frame later after the EnterState method has completed, and the events have been fired
    // 7. the 2 events indicating a state has just changed are sent to subscribers
    //          - when this event is received, a get_CurrentState property inquiry will properly return newState

    // WARNING: Making a state change directly or indirectly (e.g. thru another method or issuing an order) from a void EnterState() method
    // will cause the state machine to lose its place. This even occurs if the state change is the last line of code in the EnterState().
    // What happens: when the void EnterState() executes, it executes in ConfigureCurrentState(). When that void EnterState() changes
    // the state during that execution, CurrentState_set is called. This occurs before EnterState() and ConfigureCurrentState() completes. 
    // The 'return to here to complete' code pointer remembers it has more code in EnterState() and then ConfigureCurrentState() to execute. 
    // As a result of CurrentState_set, ConfigureCurrentState() is called again but for the new state. This ConfigureCurrentState() call 
    // is executed all the way through, including executing ExitState() and executing (or scheduling for execution via coroutine) EnterState().
    // Once this ConfigureCurrentState() completes execution, the remainder of CurrentState_set is completed. It is at this stage, that
    // the code execution path returns to finishing the original EnterState(). Once this is finished, the next line of code to execute is 
    // back to the original ConfigureCurrentState() to finish up which includes calling Run(IEnumerator). Unfortunately, since the 
    // original EnterState() returns void, the IEnumerator is null and it overwrites the previously scheduled (but not yet executed) new
    // EnterState() which then never executes. The state machine is still operational, but it has missed executing a method it was supposed
    // to execute. It will however respond to a new state change.

    // A similar problem occurs if the state machine supports state change notification events. Changing state while executing 
    // CurrentState_set means the first state change notification that occurs is the new state, not the state that caused CurrentState_set
    // to be called again. In other words, the state change notifications get out of sync. This problem is not present in 
    // AMortalItemStateMachine as it doesn't support state change notifications.
