         * Note 1: jobCompleted delegate execution delay
         * The delegate jobCompleted will be executed during the Coroutine execution phase that follows the execution 
         * of the final line of code in this job. Thus there is a time gap between Job completion and the execution of 
         * jobCompleted. For many uses, this doesn't much matter, but for time-critical uses where asynchronous events
         * can find this crack, it does. For instance, if you want to only be subscribed to an event while a Job is
         * underway, using jobCompleted to unsubscribe creates a time window where the job is no longer underway, but 
         * the event is still subscribed.
         * 
         * I've developed a pattern to get around this problem as I've found no way to build it into Job due to the lack
         * of IEnumerator.HasNext or .Peek() functionality. The pattern for the above example: 1) unsubscribe from the event
         * on the last line of the body of the IEnumerator coroutine. This handles the scenario where the job naturally
         * completes. 2) add a KillXXXJob() method that both kills the job and immediately unsubscribes from the event. 
         * This handles the scenario where the job is killed before it naturally completes.
